Color Ripples development notes

Player is trying to get a tile board to look the same as a randomly generated
"goal state" board. Might have to make goal state by doing 5-20 or however many random moves 
to make sure it's actually solveable.

When they tap a tile, all non-diagonal adjacent tiles flip colors as well.

The colors change in a pre-determined way (red -> orange, orange -> yellow, yellow ->  red). 


****None of the buttons work right now, just place holders. Reload page to get a new goal state.



Can vary the board size, and number of colors, but honestly 3x3 with two colors might be hard enough. 
Maybe should have a 2x2 with 2 colors options
