Color Squares development notes

Player is trying to get a tile board to look the same as a randomly generated
"goal state" board. 

When they tap a tile, all non-diagonal adjacent tiles flip colors as well.

The colors change in a pre-determined way (red -> orange, orange -> yellow, yellow -> green, green -> red). 

Can vary the board size, and number of colors.
